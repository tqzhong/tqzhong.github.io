I'm a second-year graduate student from [School of EEIS](https://eeis.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm), [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhendong Mao](https://faculty.ustc.edu.cn/maozhendong/zh_CN/index.htm). I am interested in natural language processing and currently working on controllable text generation and large language models.
