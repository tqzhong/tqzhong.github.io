I'm a second year postgraduate student from [School of EEIS](https://eeis.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm), [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/). My research interest includes controllable text generation and large language models in natural language processing. 

I am advised by [Zhendong Mao](https://faculty.ustc.edu.cn/maozhendong/zh_CN/index.htm) of
[Laboratory for Future Networks(LFN)](https://lfn.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm), University of Science and Technology of China.
