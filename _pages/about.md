I'm a 2nd-year graduate student from [School of EEIS](https://eeis.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm), [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhendong Mao](https://faculty.ustc.edu.cn/maozhendong/zh_CN/index.htm). My research interests lie in natural language processing and controllable text generation. Currently, I am particularly interested in the quantization of large language models. If you are interested in my work or would like to collaborate, please feel free to contact me.
