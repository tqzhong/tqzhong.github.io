Welcome to my homepage! I'm Tianqi Zhong, a 2nd-year graduate student from [School of EEIS](https://eeis.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm), [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/). I received my B.Eng. degree in Electronic Information Engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China. I am fortunate to be co-advised by [Prof. Zhendong Mao](https://faculty.ustc.edu.cn/maozhendong/zh_CN/index.htm) and [Prof. Quan Wang](https://teacher.bupt.edu.cn/wangquan/en/index/245476/list/index.htm). My research interests lie in natural language processing and attribute controllable text generation. Currently, I am particularly interested in the quantization of large language models. 

## Publications

- **Benchmarking and Improving Compositional Generalization of Multi-aspect Controllable Text Generation** `ACL2024`<br>
_<ins>Tianqi Zhong</ins>_<sup>\*</sup>, Zhaoyi Li<sup>\*</sup>, Quan Wang, Linqi Song, Ying Wei, Defu Lian, Zhendong Mao<br>
[[paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04232.pdf) [[codes]](https://github.com/tqzhong/CG4MCTG)
<img src="/images/paper_image/compmctg.png" alt="compmctg" style="zoom:50%;" /><br>
We first propose a holistic benchmark to evaluate the compositional generalization of multi-aspect controllable text generation (MCTG) and a training framework incorporating meta-learning to mitigate the compositional generalization risk in MCTG.


- **Air-Decoding: Attribute Distribution Reconstruction for Decoding-Time Controllable Text Generation** `EMNLP2023`<br>
_<ins>Tianqi Zhong</ins>_, Quan Wang, Jingxuan Han, Yongdong Zhang, Zhendong Mao<br>
[[paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.14892.pdf) [[codes]](https://github.com/tqzhong/Air-Decoding) [[poster]](/files/poster_air.pdf)
<img src="/images/paper_image/air-decoding.png" alt="air-decoding" style="zoom:45%;" /><br>
We propose a novel decoding-time controllable text generation (CTG) framework via attribute distribution reconstruction to address the problem of attribute collapse in traditional decoding-time CTG methods.
